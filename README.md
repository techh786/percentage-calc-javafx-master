Percentage Calculator in Java

Technologies Utilized: Oracle NetBeans IDE 8.2, Java SE 8.0, JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0

Description: This is a simple program written in Java, which calculates the net percentage of a number as well as the sum of the initial number plus the percentage number. Its UI has been implemented with JavaFX Scene Builder and one of the program's features worth mentioning is how it interacts according to user events.

For example, when the program executes for the first time, the only component enabled is the 'Enter initial number:' text box. All the other are initially disabled. When the user types at least one number, then the 'Enter percentage' text box and the 'Clear' command button are enabled.

Next, if a percentage number is entered in the appropriate text box, then the 'Calculate' component is activated which allows the user, if pressed, to calculate the results.

Finally, if for some reason, the user decides to clear all the contents from one text box component, then the program's behavior will be changed accordingly, e.g.: one or more components will be deactivated while some others will be available.
